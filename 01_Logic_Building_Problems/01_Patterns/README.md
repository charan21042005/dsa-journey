# 🎯 Pattern Problems – Logic Building (C++)

Welcome to the **Patterns** section of my **DSA & Logic Building Journey** 🚀  
This folder is dedicated to mastering **pattern-based problems**, which form the **foundation of logical thinking** in programming.

Patterns are not just about printing shapes — they train your brain to:
- Think in **rows & columns**
- Master **nested loops**
- Build **step-by-step logic**
- Improve **visual problem-solving skills**

---

## 🧠 Why Pattern Problems Matter?

Pattern problems help you:

- Understand **loop flow deeply**
- Gain control over **nested loops**
- Learn **condition placement**
- Prepare for:
  - Coding interviews
  - Competitive programming
  - DSA fundamentals

> 💡 If you can solve patterns confidently, you can handle complex logic easily.

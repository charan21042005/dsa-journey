# 🧠 Logic Building Problems (C++)

This folder is dedicated to **logic building and problem-solving fundamentals** using **C++**.  
It focuses on sharpening **thinking skills**, **mathematical reasoning**, and **pattern recognition**, which are essential before diving into advanced DSA topics.

This section is a core part of my **DSA Journey**, where I practice problems **daily** and maintain a clean, structured record of my progress.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Strengthen **problem-solving mindset**
- Improve **logical thinking**
- Practice **math-based reasoning**
- Master **loop-based patterns**
- Build confidence for:
  - Competitive programming
  - Coding interviews
  - Advanced DSA concepts

Each subfolder focuses on a **specific category of logic problems** and contains:
* Its own `README.md`
* Well-documented `.cpp`solution files

## 📁 01_Patterns

This folder contains **pattern-based problems**, which help in:

- Understanding **nested loops**
- Visualizing **logic flow**
- Improving control over **loops and conditions**

### Covers:
- ⭐ Star patterns  
- 🔢 Number patterns  
- 🔺 Pyramid patterns  
- 🔻 Inverted & combined patterns  

➡️ Go to: **[`01_Patterns/`](./01_Patterns)**

## 📁 02_Maths_and_Logic

This folder focuses on **mathematical and logical problems**, essential for **interviews** and **competitive programming**.

### Covers:
- Number theory basics  
- Digits manipulation  
- Prime number logic  
- GCD / LCM  
- Basic math tricks  
- Logical edge cases  

➡️ Go to: **[`02_Maths_and_Logic/`](./02_Maths_and_Logic)**

---

## 📌 Coding Standards Followed

- Clean & readable **C++ code**
- Proper **indentation**
- Meaningful **variable names**
- Detailed **comments**
- Full **standalone programs** where applicable
- **Multiple approaches** explained (when possible)

## 📈 Learning Strategy

1. Understand the problem  
2. Dry run with examples  
3. Write logic step-by-step  
4. Code in C++  
5. Optimize if needed  
6. Document learnings in README

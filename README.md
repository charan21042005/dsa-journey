# Data Structures & Algorithms Journey

This repository documents my **personal learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms**.  
It is built from scratch as I learn, practice, and strengthen my problem-solving skills for  
software engineering interviews and placements.

---

## 📌 What this repository is about

- A **topic-wise structured DSA learning path**
- **Self-written notes** explaining concepts in simple terms
- **Clean and readable code implementations**
- Gradual progression from **basics to advanced problems**
- Focus on **understanding patterns**, not memorizing solutions

All content here reflects my own learning and understanding.

---

## 🧠 How I use this repository

For each DSA topic, I follow a consistent approach:

1. Learn the **core concept**
2. Write **short notes** in my own words
3. Identify common **problem-solving patterns**
4. Implement solutions with **clean code**
5. Improve solutions over time if needed

This helps me track progress and revise effectively.

## 📝 Notes Format

Each `notes.md` file typically includes:
- Key concepts
- Important observations
- Common patterns
- Mistakes to avoid
- List of practiced problems

This makes revision quick and effective.

---

## 💻 Languages Used

- **C++** (primary)
- Java / Python (may be added later if required)

---

## 🎯 Goal of this repository

- Build a **strong DSA foundation**
- Improve **problem-solving and logical thinking**
- Prepare for **technical interviews and coding rounds**
- Maintain **consistent daily practice**

# Basics

This folder represents the **foundation stage** of my Data Structures and Algorithms journey.

The goal of this section is to build **strong C++ fundamentals and logical thinking**
before moving on to core data structures and advanced algorithms.

A solid understanding of these basics ensures that future DSA concepts are easier to
learn, implement, and optimize.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of this section

- Build confidence in **C++ programming fundamentals**
- Develop **problem-solving and logical thinking skills**
- Understand how to **translate logic into clean C++ code**
- Prepare a strong base for Arrays, Strings, Recursion, and beyond

---

## 📘 Topics covered

This section will gradually cover:

- Basic C++ syntax and program structure
- Input / Output operations
- Data types and variables
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Functions and parameter passing
- Basic mathematics for programming
- Logic building problems (patterns, number problems, etc.)
- Common beginner mistakes and best practices

## 📝 Notes section (`Notes/`)

The **Notes** folder contains self-written Markdown files that explain:

- Concepts in simple language
- Syntax with small examples
- Important observations
- Common mistakes beginners make
- When and where each concept is used in DSA

These notes are meant for **quick revision and clarity**, not copy-paste learning.

---

## 💻 Codes section (`Codes/`)

The **Codes** folder contains clean and beginner-friendly **C++ source files**.

Each file focuses on:
- One concept or logic
- Readable variable names
- Step-by-step implementation
- Correct use of fundamentals

The code here is written to **understand logic first**, not to over-optimize.

---

## 🔁 Learning approach followed

For each topic in this section, I follow this approach:

1. Learn the concept
2. Write notes in my own words
3. Practice basic logic problems
4. Implement solutions in C++
5. Improve code clarity over time

---

## 🚀 Why this section matters

Many DSA problems fail not because of complex algorithms, but due to weak fundamentals.
This section ensures that I have:

- Strong control over C++
- Clear logical thinking
- Confidence to approach advanced DSA topics

> This folder will continue to evolve as my understanding improves.

⭐ *Strong foundations lead to strong problem solving.*

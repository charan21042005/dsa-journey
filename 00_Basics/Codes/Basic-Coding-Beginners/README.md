# 🧩 Basic Coding – Beginners (C++)

This folder contains **basic beginner-level C++ programs** written as part of my  
**Data Structures & Algorithms learning journey**.

The codes here focus on:
- Strengthening **C++ fundamentals**
- Improving **logic building**
- Translating basic concepts into working programs

These programs are **not strictly topic-wise**.  
Instead, they are **simple, foundational problems** that every beginner should practice
before moving to advanced DSA topics.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this folder

- Practice **core C++ syntax**
- Build confidence with **basic logic**
- Understand how small programs work end-to-end
- Prepare a strong base for:
  - Operators
  - Conditions
  - Loops
  - Functions
  - Arrays and beyond

---

## 🧠 How this folder is organized

- Each program is written in a **separate `.cpp` file**
- Files are **numbered in sequence** for easy tracking
- File names are **descriptive**, indicating what the program does

### 📌 Naming Convention

```text
1_hello_world.cpp
2_input_output.cpp
3_data_types.cpp
4_arithmetic_operations.cpp
5_if_else_example.cpp
```
This makes it easy to:
* Follow progress step by step
* Refer back to older programs
* Link problems directly to solutions

## 📋 List of Programs (will be updated)
| No. | Program Name             | Code Link                     |
| --- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 1   | Hello World Program      | `1_hello_world.cpp`           |
| 2   | Basic Input and Output   | `2_input_output.cpp`          |
| 3   | Data Types Demonstration | `3_data_types.cpp`            |
| 4   | Arithmetic Operations    | `4_arithmetic_operations.cpp` |
| 5   | If-Else Example          | `5_if_else_example.cpp`       |

> 🔹 More programs will be added as I continue practicing.

(Links will open the corresponding `.cpp` file inside this folder.)

## 📝 Coding Guidelines Followed
* Clean and readable code
* Meaningful variable names
* Proper indentation
* Comments where required
* Full working programs (#include → main() → return 0)

## 🚀 Learning Approach
1. Understand the concept from notes
2. Think about the logic
3. Write the program from scratch
4. Test with sample inputs
5. Improve clarity if needed

⭐ Strong basics build strong problem solvers.

This folder will grow as my understanding improves.

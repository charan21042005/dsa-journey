# Operators in C++
Operators are **symbols** that tell the compiler to perform specific
operations on operands (values or variables).

Operators are one of the **most important building blocks** in C++ because:
- They help perform calculations
- They control logic and conditions
- They are heavily used in loops and DSA problems

## 🔹 C++ Operator Types
C++ operators are classified based on:
1. **Purpose** (Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, etc.)
2. **Number of operands** they work on

In this section, we focus on **Arithmetic Operators**, which are the foundation
for calculations and logic building.

## 🔹 1. Arithmetic Operators in C++

Arithmetic operators are used to perform **basic mathematical operations**.

### 📘 List of Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
|-------|------|------------|
| `+` | Addition | Adds two operands |
| `-` | Subtraction | Subtracts right operand from left |
| `*` | Multiplication | Multiplies two operands |
| `/` | Division | Divides left operand by right |
| `%` | Modulo | Returns remainder |
| `++` | Increment | Increases value by 1 |
| `--` | Decrement | Decreases value by 1 |

### 1️⃣ Addition Operator (`+`)

```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 5;
int sum = a + b;

cout << sum;
```
* Adds two operands
* Works with integers and floating-point numbers

### 2️⃣ Subtraction Operator (`-`)
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 4;
int diff = a - b;

cout << diff;
```
* Subtracts right operand from left

### 3️⃣ Multiplication Operator (`*`)
```cpp
int a = 6;
int b = 5;
int product = a * b;

cout << product;
```
* Multiplies two values

### 4️⃣ Division Operator (`/`)
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 3;

cout << a / b;
```
Output:
```cpp
3
```
Explanation:
* Integer division discards the decimal part

**Division with Floating-Point Values**
```cpp
float a = 10;
float b = 3;

cout << a / b;
```
Output:
```cpp
3.33333
```
* Division works with floating-point numbers

### 5️⃣ Modulo Operator (`%`)
The modulo operator returns the **remainder** after division.
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 3;

cout << a % b;
```
Output:
```cpp
1
```
**🔴 Important Point (VERY IMPORTANT)**
> The modulo operator (`%`) works only with integers.

❌ Invalid:
```cpp
float a = 10.5;
float b = 2.5;
// cout << a % b;  ❌ Error
```
✔ Valid:
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 3;
cout << a % b;
```

### 6️⃣ Increment Operator (`++`)
The increment operator increases a variable’s value by 1.

There are two types:
1. Pre-increment (++a)
2. Post-increment (a++)

### Pre-Increment (`++a`)
```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = ++a;

cout << a << " " << b;
```
Output:
```cpp
6 6
```
Explanation:
* Value of `a` is incremented first
* Then assigned to `b`

### Post-Increment (`a++`)
```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = a++;

cout << a << " " << b;
```
Output:
```cpp
6 5
```
Explanation:
* Value of `a` is assigned first
* Then incremented

### 7️⃣ Decrement Operator (--)
The decrement operator decreases a variable’s value by 1.

### Pre-Decrement (`--a`)
```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = --a;

cout << a << " " << b;
```
Output:
```cpp
4 4
```

### Post-Decrement (`a--`)
```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = a--;

cout << a << " " << b;
```
Output:
```cpp
4 5
```

## 🔹 Operators Based on Number of Operands
Operators are also classified based on how many **operands** they work with.

### 1️⃣ Unary Operators
Unary operators work on **a single operand**.

Examples
```cpp
int a = 5;
cout << ++a;
```
Common unary operators:
* `++`
* `--`
* `!` (logical NOT)
* `-` (unary minus)

### 2️⃣ Binary Operators
Binary operators work on **two operands**.

Examples
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

cout << a + b;
```
Most arithmetic, relational, and logical operators are binary.

### 3️⃣ Ternary Operator (`?:`)

The ternary operator works on **three operands**.

**Syntax**
```cpp
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```
Example
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
cout << max;
```
Explanation:
* If condition is true → `expression1`
* Else → `expression2`

### 🔹 Summary
* Operators perform operations on variables and values
* Arithmetic operators handle calculations
* `%` works only with integers
* `++a` and `a++` behave differently
* Operators are classified as:
  * Unary
  * Binary
  * Ternary

Understanding operators is **crucial for logic building**, loop control,
and solving **DSA problems efficiently**.

## 🔹 2. Relational Operators in C++
Relational operators are used to **compare two values or variables**.
They return a **boolean result**:
- `true` (1)
- `false` (0)

These operators are heavily used in:
- Conditions
- Loops
- Decision making

### 📘 List of Relational Operators
| Operator | Name | Description |
|-------|------|------------|
| `==` | Equal to | Checks if two values are equal |
| `!=` | Not equal to | Checks if values are not equal |
| `>` | Greater than | Checks if left > right |
| `<` | Less than | Checks if left < right |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | Checks if left ≥ right |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | Checks if left ≤ right |

Example
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

cout << (a == b);   // 0
cout << (a != b);   // 1
cout << (a > b);    // 0
cout << (a < b);    // 1
cout << (a >= b);   // 0
cout << (a <= b);   // 1
```
**Important Note**
❌ Do NOT confuse:
```cpp
a = b;   // Assignment
a == b;  // Comparison
```

---

## 🔹 3. Logical Operators in C++
Logical operators are used to **combine or modify conditions** and always return
a boolean result (`true` or `false`).

### 📘 List of Logical Operators in C++
| Operator | Name | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `&&` | Logical AND | Returns `true` if **both conditions** are true |
| `\|\|` | Logical OR | Returns `true` if **at least one condition** is true |
| `!` | Logical NOT | Reverses the result of a condition |

### Logical AND (`&&`)
```cpp
int age = 20;

if (age >= 18 && age <= 60) {
    cout << "Eligible";
}
```
✔ Both conditions must be true

### Logical OR (`||`)
```cpp
int day = 6;

if (day == 6 || day == 7) {
    cout << "Weekend";
}
```
✔ At least one condition must be true

### Logical NOT (`!`)
```cpp
bool isLoggedIn = false;

if (!isLoggedIn) {
    cout << "Please login";
}
```
✔ Reverses the boolean value

## 🔹 4. Bitwise Operators in C++

Bitwise operators work at the **bit level (0s and 1s)**.
They are commonly used in:
* Low-level programming
* Optimization
* Competitive programming

### 📘 Bitwise Operators List
| Operator | Name             | Description       |        
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| `&`      | Bitwise AND      | AND operation     |    
| `        | `                | Bitwise OR        | 
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR      | Exclusive OR      |        
| `<<`     | Left Shift       | Shifts bits left  |             
| `>>`     | Right Shift      | Shifts bits right |              
| `~`      | One’s Complement | Inverts bits      |       

### Bitwise AND (`&`)
```cpp
int a = 5;   // 0101
int b = 3;   // 0011

cout << (a & b);   // 1
```

### Bitwise OR (`|`)
```cpp
cout << (a | b);   // 7
```

### Bitwise XOR (`^`)
```cpp
cout << (a ^ b);   // 6
```

### Left Shift (`<<`)
```cpp
int x = 5;
cout << (x << 1);  // 10
```
Explanation:
* Shifts bits left
* Multiplies by 2

### Right Shift (`>>`)
```cpp
cout << (x >> 1);  // 2
```
Explanation:
* Shifts bits right
* Divides by 2

### One’s Complement (`~`)
```cpp
int x = 5;
cout << ~x;
```
Explanation:
* Flips all bits
* Result is negative due to two’s complement

# Operators in C++
Operators are **symbols** that tell the compiler to perform specific
operations on operands (values or variables).

Operators are one of the **most important building blocks** in C++ because:
- They help perform calculations
- They control logic and conditions
- They are heavily used in loops and DSA problems

## 🔹 C++ Operator Types
C++ operators are classified based on:
1. **Purpose** (Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, etc.)
2. **Number of operands** they work on

In this section, we focus on **Arithmetic Operators**, which are the foundation
for calculations and logic building.

## 🔹 1. Arithmetic Operators in C++

Arithmetic operators are used to perform **basic mathematical operations**.

### 📘 List of Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
|-------|------|------------|
| `+` | Addition | Adds two operands |
| `-` | Subtraction | Subtracts right operand from left |
| `*` | Multiplication | Multiplies two operands |
| `/` | Division | Divides left operand by right |
| `%` | Modulo | Returns remainder |
| `++` | Increment | Increases value by 1 |
| `--` | Decrement | Decreases value by 1 |

### 1️⃣ Addition Operator (`+`)

```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 5;
int sum = a + b;

cout << sum;
```
* Adds two operands
* Works with integers and floating-point numbers

### 2️⃣ Subtraction Operator (`-`)
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 4;
int diff = a - b;

cout << diff;
```
* Subtracts right operand from left

### 3️⃣ Multiplication Operator (`*`)
```cpp
int a = 6;
int b = 5;
int product = a * b;

cout << product;
```
* Multiplies two values

### 4️⃣ Division Operator (`/`)
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 3;

cout << a / b;
```
Output:
```cpp
3
```
Explanation:
* Integer division discards the decimal part

**Division with Floating-Point Values**
```cpp
float a = 10;
float b = 3;

cout << a / b;
```
Output:
```cpp
3.33333
```
* Division works with floating-point numbers

### 5️⃣ Modulo Operator (`%`)
The modulo operator returns the **remainder** after division.
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 3;

cout << a % b;
```
Output:
```cpp
1
```
**🔴 Important Point (VERY IMPORTANT)**
> The modulo operator (`%`) works only with integers.

❌ Invalid:
```cpp
float a = 10.5;
float b = 2.5;
// cout << a % b;  ❌ Error
```
✔ Valid:
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 3;
cout << a % b;
```

### 6️⃣ Increment Operator (`++`)
The increment operator increases a variable’s value by 1.

There are two types:
1. Pre-increment (++a)
2. Post-increment (a++)

### Pre-Increment (`++a`)
```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = ++a;

cout << a << " " << b;
```
Output:
```cpp
6 6
```
Explanation:
* Value of `a` is incremented first
* Then assigned to `b`

### Post-Increment (`a++`)
```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = a++;

cout << a << " " << b;
```
Output:
```cpp
6 5
```
Explanation:
* Value of `a` is assigned first
* Then incremented

### 7️⃣ Decrement Operator (--)
The decrement operator decreases a variable’s value by 1.

### Pre-Decrement (`--a`)
```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = --a;

cout << a << " " << b;
```
Output:
```cpp
4 4
```

### Post-Decrement (`a--`)
```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = a--;

cout << a << " " << b;
```
Output:
```cpp
4 5
```

---

## 🔹 Operators Based on Number of Operands
Operators are also classified based on how many **operands** they work with.

### 1️⃣ Unary Operators
Unary operators work on **a single operand**.

Examples
```cpp
int a = 5;
cout << ++a;
```
Common unary operators:
* `++`
* `--`
* `!` (logical NOT)
* `-` (unary minus)

### 2️⃣ Binary Operators
Binary operators work on **two operands**.

Examples
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

cout << a + b;
```
Most arithmetic, relational, and logical operators are binary.

### 3️⃣ Ternary Operator (`?:`)

The ternary operator works on **three operands**.

**Syntax**
```cpp
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```
Example
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
cout << max;
```
Explanation:
* If condition is true → `expression1`
* Else → `expression2`

### 🔹 Summary
* Operators perform operations on variables and values
* Arithmetic operators handle calculations
* `%` works only with integers
* `++a` and `a++` behave differently
* Operators are classified as:
  * Unary
  * Binary
  * Ternary

Understanding operators is **crucial for logic building**, loop control,
and solving **DSA problems efficiently**.

## 🔹 2. Relational Operators in C++
Relational operators are used to **compare two values or variables**.
They return a **boolean result**:
- `true` (1)
- `false` (0)

These operators are heavily used in:
- Conditions
- Loops
- Decision making

### 📘 List of Relational Operators
| Operator | Name | Description |
|-------|------|------------|
| `==` | Equal to | Checks if two values are equal |
| `!=` | Not equal to | Checks if values are not equal |
| `>` | Greater than | Checks if left > right |
| `<` | Less than | Checks if left < right |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | Checks if left ≥ right |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | Checks if left ≤ right |

Example
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

cout << (a == b);   // 0
cout << (a != b);   // 1
cout << (a > b);    // 0
cout << (a < b);    // 1
cout << (a >= b);   // 0
cout << (a <= b);   // 1
```
**Important Note**
❌ Do NOT confuse:
```cpp
a = b;   // Assignment
a == b;  // Comparison
```

---

## 🔹 3. Logical Operators in C++
Logical operators are used to **combine or modify conditions** and always return
a boolean result (`true` or `false`).

### 📘 List of Logical Operators in C++
| Operator | Name | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `&&` | Logical AND | Returns `true` if **both conditions** are true |
| `\|\|` | Logical OR | Returns `true` if **at least one condition** is true |
| `!` | Logical NOT | Reverses the result of a condition |

### Logical AND (`&&`)
```cpp
int age = 20;

if (age >= 18 && age <= 60) {
    cout << "Eligible";
}
```
✔ Both conditions must be true

### Logical OR (`||`)
```cpp
int day = 6;

if (day == 6 || day == 7) {
    cout << "Weekend";
}
```
✔ At least one condition must be true

### Logical NOT (`!`)
```cpp
bool isLoggedIn = false;

if (!isLoggedIn) {
    cout << "Please login";
}
```
✔ Reverses the boolean value

## 🔹 4. Bitwise Operators in C++

Bitwise operators work at the **bit level (0s and 1s)**.
They are commonly used in:
* Low-level programming
* Optimization
* Competitive programming

### 📘 Bitwise Operators List
| Operator | Name             | Description       |        
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| `&`      | Bitwise AND      | AND operation     |    
| `        | `                | Bitwise OR        | 
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR      | Exclusive OR      |        
| `<<`     | Left Shift       | Shifts bits left  |             
| `>>`     | Right Shift      | Shifts bits right |              
| `~`      | One’s Complement | Inverts bits      |       

### Bitwise AND (`&`)
```cpp
int a = 5;   // 0101
int b = 3;   // 0011

cout << (a & b);   // 1
```

### Bitwise OR (`|`)
```cpp
cout << (a | b);   // 7
```

### Bitwise XOR (`^`)
```cpp
cout << (a ^ b);   // 6
```

### Left Shift (`<<`)
```cpp
int x = 5;
cout << (x << 1);  // 10
```
Explanation:
* Shifts bits left
* Multiplies by 2

### Right Shift (`>>`)
```cpp
cout << (x >> 1);  // 2
```
Explanation:
* Shifts bits right
* Divides by 2

### One’s Complement (`~`)
```cpp
int x = 5;
cout << ~x;
```
Explanation:
* Flips all bits
* Result is negative due to two’s complement

---

## 🔹 5. Assignment Operators in C++
Assignment operators are used to **assign values** to variables.

### 📘 Assignment Operators List
| Operator | Meaning             | Example  |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| `=`      | Assignment          | `a = 5`  |
| `+=`     | Add and assign      | `a += 3` |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign | `a -= 2` |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign | `a *= 4` |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign   | `a /= 2` |

Example
```cpp
int a = 10;

a += 5;   // 15
a -= 3;   // 12
a *= 2;   // 24
a /= 4;   // 6
```

### Why Use Assignment Operators?
* Shorter code
* Cleaner syntax
* Better readability

---

## 🔹 6. Ternary (Conditional) Operator
The ternary operator is a short-hand replacement for `if-else`.

### Syntax
```cpp
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```

Example
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
cout << max;

Equivalent if-else
int max;
if (a > b)
    max = a;
else
    max = b;
```
### Key Points
| Feature       | Description          |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Operands      | 3                    |
| Operator type | Ternary              |
| Use case      | Simple conditions    |
| Readability   | High for small logic |


### ✅ Summary
* Relational operators compare values
* Logical operators combine conditions
* Bitwise operators work on bits
* Assignment operators simplify updates
* Ternary operator replaces simple if-else

These operators form the **core logic-building tools** required for:
* Conditions
* Loops
* Competitive programming
* DSA problem solving

## 🔹 Miscellaneous Operators in C++

Apart from arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators,
C++ provides several **miscellaneous operators** that are extremely important
for memory handling, object access, and advanced programming.

### 1️⃣ `sizeof` Operator

The `sizeof` operator is used to determine the **size (in bytes)** of a data type or variable.

### Syntax
```cpp
sizeof(data_type);
sizeof(variable);
```

Example
```cpp
int a;
double b;

cout << sizeof(a) << endl;
cout << sizeof(b) << endl;
```

### Key Points
| Feature     | Description         |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Return type | `size_t`            |
| Evaluated   | Compile time        |
| Use case    | Memory optimization |

---

### 2️⃣ Comma Operator (`,`)

The comma operator allows **multiple expressions** to be evaluated in a single statement.
The **value of the last expression** is returned.

Example
```cpp
int x = (10, 20, 30);
cout << x;
```
Output:
```cpp
30
```

### Usage in Loops
```cpp
for (int i = 0, j = 5; i <= j; i++, j--) {
    cout << i << " " << j << endl;
}
```

---

### 3️⃣ Address-of Operator (`&`)

The address-of operator is used to obtain the **memory address of a variable**.

Example
```cpp
int x = 10;
cout << &x;
```

### Key Points
* Returns the address in memory
* Used heavily with pointers
* Important for DSA and memory management

---

### 4️⃣ Dot Operator (.)

The dot operator is used to **access members of a structure or class object**.

Example
```CPP
struct Student {
    int roll;
    float marks;
};

Student s;
s.roll = 1;
s.marks = 95.5;

cout << s.roll << " " << s.marks;
```
### Usage
* Used with objects
* Accesses data members and member functions

---

### 5️⃣ Arrow Operator (->)

The arrow operator is used to **access members of a structure or class through a pointer**.

Example
```CPP
struct Student {
    int roll;
};

Student s;
Student* ptr = &s;

ptr->roll = 10;
cout << ptr->roll;
```

### Difference: Dot vs Arrow
| Operator | Used With         |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| `.`      | Object            |
| `->`     | Pointer to object |

--- 

### 6️⃣ Casting Operators

Casting operators are used to **convert one data type to another**.

### C-style Casting
```cpp
double x = 9.8;
int y = (int)x;
```
### C++ Style Casting (Preferred)
```cpp
int y = static_cast<int>(x);
```
### Why Casting Is Needed
* Type compatibility
* Precision control
* Explicit conversions

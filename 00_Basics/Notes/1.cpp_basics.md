# C++ Basics – Detailed Notes

This document covers the **fundamental concepts of C++ programming**.
These basics form the foundation for **logic building and Data Structures & Algorithms**.

## 🔹 Introduction to C++

C++ is a **general-purpose, compiled programming language** developed as an extension of C.
It supports:
- Procedural programming
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Low-level memory manipulation
- High performance applications

C++ is widely used in:
- Competitive programming
- System software
- Game development
- Backend services
- Data Structures & Algorithms

A strong understanding of C++ basics is essential to write **efficient, optimized, and readable DSA solutions**.

## 🔹 Basic C++ Program Structure

Below is a simple C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // This prints Hello World!
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

Program Structure Visualization

Now let’s understand each line and component in detail.

1️⃣ Preprocessor Directives

#include <iostream>
* Lines starting with # are called preprocessor directives
* They are executed before compilation
* `#include` tells the compiler to include predefined code
* `<iostream>` is a header file that enables input and output operations


2️⃣ Header Files

Header files contain declarations of functions and objects.

* `iostream` provides:
  * `cout` → output
  * `cin` → input
* Without including `iostream`, input/output operations will not work


3️⃣ Namespace
```cpp
using namespace std;
```

* `std` is the standard namespace
* It contains standard objects like `cout`, `cin`, `endl`
* Using `using namespace std`; avoids writing `std::cout` repeatedly

Example without namespace
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello";
```

4️⃣ Main Function
```cpp
int main() {
    // code
}
```

* main() is the entry point of every C++ program
* Program execution always starts from main
* int indicates the function returns an integer value


5️⃣ Comments in C++
```cpp
// Single-line comment

/*
Multi-line
comment
*/
```

* Comments are ignored by the compiler
* Used to explain code and improve readability


6️⃣ Output Statement
```cpp
cout << "Hello, World!";
```
* `cout` is used to display output
* `<<` is called the insertion operator
* Text inside double quotes is printed as it is


7️⃣ Return Statement
```cpp
return 0;
```

* Returns control back to the operating system
* `0` indicates successful execution
* Required because `main()` has return type `int`

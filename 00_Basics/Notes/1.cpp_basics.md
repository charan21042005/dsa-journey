# C++ Basics – Detailed Notes

This document covers the **fundamental concepts of C++ programming**.
These basics form the foundation for **logic building and Data Structures & Algorithms**.

## 🔹 Introduction to C++

C++ is a **general-purpose, compiled programming language** developed as an extension of C.
It supports:
- Procedural programming
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Low-level memory manipulation
- High performance applications

C++ is widely used in:
- Competitive programming
- System software
- Game development
- Backend services
- Data Structures & Algorithms

A strong understanding of C++ basics is essential to write **efficient, optimized, and readable DSA solutions**.

## 🔹 Basic C++ Program Structure

Below is a simple C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // This prints Hello World!
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```
Program Structure Visualization

Now let’s understand each line and component in detail.

1️⃣ Preprocessor Directives

#include <iostream>
* Lines starting with # are called preprocessor directives

* They are executed before compilation

* `#include` tells the compiler to include predefined code

* `<iostream>` is a header file that enables input and output operations


2️⃣ Header Files

Header files contain declarations of functions and objects.

* `iostream` provides:

  * `cout` → output

  * `cin` → input

* Without including `iostream`, input/output operations will not work


3️⃣ Namespace
```cpp
using namespace std;
```

* `std` is the standard namespace

* It contains standard objects like `cout`, `cin`, `endl`

* Using `using namespace std`; avoids writing `std::cout` repeatedly

Example without namespace
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello";
```

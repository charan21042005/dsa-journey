# C++ Basics – Detailed Notes

This document covers the **fundamental concepts of C++ programming**.
These basics form the foundation for **logic building and Data Structures & Algorithms**.

---

## 🔹 Introduction to C++

C++ is a **general-purpose, compiled programming language** developed as an extension of C.
It supports:
- Procedural programming
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Low-level memory manipulation
- High performance applications

C++ is widely used in:
- Competitive programming
- System software
- Game development
- Backend services
- Data Structures & Algorithms

A strong understanding of C++ basics is essential to write **efficient, optimized, and readable DSA solutions**.

## 🔹 Basic C++ Program Structure

Below is a simple C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // This prints Hello World!
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

Program Structure Visualization

Now let’s understand each line and component in detail.

1️⃣ Preprocessor Directives

#include <iostream>
* Lines starting with # are called preprocessor directives
* They are executed before compilation
* `#include` tells the compiler to include predefined code
* `<iostream>` is a header file that enables input and output operations


2️⃣ Header Files

Header files contain declarations of functions and objects.

* `iostream` provides:
  * `cout` → output
  * `cin` → input
* Without including `iostream`, input/output operations will not work


3️⃣ Namespace
```cpp
using namespace std;
```

* `std` is the standard namespace
* It contains standard objects like `cout`, `cin`, `endl`
* Using `using namespace std`; avoids writing `std::cout` repeatedly

Example without namespace
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello";
```

4️⃣ Main Function
```cpp
int main() {
    // code
}
```

* main() is the entry point of every C++ program
* Program execution always starts from main
* int indicates the function returns an integer value


5️⃣ Comments in C++
```cpp
// Single-line comment

/*
Multi-line
comment
*/
```

* Comments are ignored by the compiler
* Used to explain code and improve readability


6️⃣ Output Statement
```cpp
cout << "Hello, World!";
```
* `cout` is used to display output
* `<<` is called the insertion operator
* Text inside double quotes is printed as it is


7️⃣ Return Statement
```cpp
return 0;
```

* Returns control back to the operating system
* `0` indicates successful execution
* Required because `main()` has return type `int`

## 🔹 Data Types in C++

Data types specify:
- What **type of data** a variable can store
- How much **memory** is allocated
- What kind of **operations** can be performed on the data

Below is the classification of data types in C++.

![Data Types in C++](../Images/2.Screenshot%202025-12-24%20132414.png)

---

1️⃣ Character Data Type (`char`)

The `char` data type is used to store a **single character**.

```cpp
char grade = 'A';
```
Key points:
* Stores one character only
* Written inside single quotes
* Uses 1 byte of memory
* Internally stores ASCII values

```cpp
Example:

char ch = 'a';
cout << ch;
```
Common use cases:
* Characters
* Symbols
* Single letters

2️⃣ Integer Data Type (`int`)

The int data type is used to store whole numbers (positive or negative).
```cpp
int age = 20;
```
Key points:
* Stores numbers without decimal points
* Typically occupies 4 bytes
* Can store values like -10, 0, 100

Example:
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int sum = a + b;
cout << sum;
```
Used in:
* Counting
* Loop variables
* Indexing arrays

3️⃣ Boolean Data Type (`bool`)

The bool data type stores logical values.
```cpp
bool isPassed = true;
```
Key points:
* Can store only true or false
* Internally represented as:
  * true → 1
  * false → 0
* Uses 1 byte of memory

Example:
```cpp
bool isAdult = (age >= 18);
cout << isAdult;
```
Used in:
* Conditions
* Decision making
* Loops

4️⃣ Floating Point Data Type (`float`)

The `float` data type is used to store decimal numbers.
```cpp
float marks = 85.5;
```
Key points:
* Stores decimal values
* Single precision
* Less accurate than double
* Uses 4 bytes of memory

Example:
```cpp
float price = 99.99;
cout << price;
```
Used in:
* Measurements
* Percentages
* Approximate calculations

5️⃣ Double Data Type (`double`)

The `double` data type stores decimal numbers with higher precision.
```cpp
double salary = 45678.9876;
```
Key points:
* Double precision floating point
* More accurate than float
* Uses 8 bytes of memory

Example:
```cpp
double pi = 3.1415926535;
cout << pi;
```

Preferred over `float` when:
* Accuracy matters
* Large decimal values are used

6️⃣ Void Data Type (`void`)

The `void` data type represents no value.

It is mainly used with functions that **do not return anything**.
```cpp
void displayMessage() {
    cout << "Welcome to C++";
}
```
Key points:
* Indicates absence of a return value
* Cannot be used to declare normal variables
* Commonly used in function definitions

🔑 Summary of Data Types
* `char` → single character
* `int` → whole numbers
* `bool` → true/false values
* `floa`t → decimal numbers (less precision)
* `double` → decimal numbers (high precision)
* `void` → no return value

Understanding data types is crucial for:
* Memory management
* Correct program behavior
* Writing efficient DSA solutions

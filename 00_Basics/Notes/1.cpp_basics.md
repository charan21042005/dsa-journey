# C++ Basics – Detailed Notes

This document covers the **fundamental concepts of C++ programming**.
These basics form the foundation for **logic building and Data Structures & Algorithms**.

---

## 🔹 Introduction to C++

C++ is a **general-purpose, compiled programming language** developed as an extension of C.
It supports:
- Procedural programming
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Low-level memory manipulation
- High performance applications

C++ is widely used in:
- Competitive programming
- System software
- Game development
- Backend services
- Data Structures & Algorithms

A strong understanding of C++ basics is essential to write **efficient, optimized, and readable DSA solutions**.

## 🔹 Basic C++ Program Structure

Below is a simple C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // This prints Hello World!
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```
---

Program Structure Visualization

Now let’s understand each line and component in detail.

1️⃣ Preprocessor Directives

#include <iostream>
* Lines starting with # are called preprocessor directives
* They are executed before compilation
* `#include` tells the compiler to include predefined code
* `<iostream>` is a header file that enables input and output operations


2️⃣ Header Files

Header files contain declarations of functions and objects.

* `iostream` provides:
  * `cout` → output
  * `cin` → input
* Without including `iostream`, input/output operations will not work


3️⃣ Namespace
```cpp
using namespace std;
```

* `std` is the standard namespace
* It contains standard objects like `cout`, `cin`, `endl`
* Using `using namespace std`; avoids writing `std::cout` repeatedly

Example without namespace
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello";
```

4️⃣ Main Function
```cpp
int main() {
    // code
}
```

* main() is the entry point of every C++ program
* Program execution always starts from main
* int indicates the function returns an integer value


5️⃣ Comments in C++
```cpp
// Single-line comment

/*
Multi-line
comment
*/
```

* Comments are ignored by the compiler
* Used to explain code and improve readability


6️⃣ Output Statement
```cpp
cout << "Hello, World!";
```
* `cout` is used to display output
* `<<` is called the insertion operator
* Text inside double quotes is printed as it is


7️⃣ Return Statement
```cpp
return 0;
```

* Returns control back to the operating system
* `0` indicates successful execution
* Required because `main()` has return type `int`

## 🔹 Data Types in C++

Data types specify:
- What **type of data** a variable can store
- How much **memory** is allocated
- What kind of **operations** can be performed on the data

Below is the classification of data types in C++.

![Data Types in C++](../Images/2.Screenshot%202025-12-24%20132414.png)

---

1️⃣ Character Data Type (`char`)

The `char` data type is used to store a **single character**.

```cpp
char grade = 'A';
```
Key points:
* Stores one character only
* Written inside single quotes
* Uses 1 byte of memory
* Internally stores ASCII values

```cpp
Example:

char ch = 'a';
cout << ch;
```
Common use cases:
* Characters
* Symbols
* Single letters

2️⃣ Integer Data Type (`int`)

The int data type is used to store whole numbers (positive or negative).
```cpp
int age = 20;
```
Key points:
* Stores numbers without decimal points
* Typically occupies 4 bytes
* Can store values like -10, 0, 100

Example:
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int sum = a + b;
cout << sum;
```
Used in:
* Counting
* Loop variables
* Indexing arrays

3️⃣ Boolean Data Type (`bool`)

The bool data type stores logical values.
```cpp
bool isPassed = true;
```
Key points:
* Can store only true or false
* Internally represented as:
  * true → 1
  * false → 0
* Uses 1 byte of memory

Example:
```cpp
bool isAdult = (age >= 18);
cout << isAdult;
```
Used in:
* Conditions
* Decision making
* Loops

4️⃣ Floating Point Data Type (`float`)

The `float` data type is used to store decimal numbers.
```cpp
float marks = 85.5;
```
Key points:
* Stores decimal values
* Single precision
* Less accurate than double
* Uses 4 bytes of memory

Example:
```cpp
float price = 99.99;
cout << price;
```
Used in:
* Measurements
* Percentages
* Approximate calculations

5️⃣ Double Data Type (`double`)

The `double` data type stores decimal numbers with higher precision.
```cpp
double salary = 45678.9876;
```
Key points:
* Double precision floating point
* More accurate than float
* Uses 8 bytes of memory

Example:
```cpp
double pi = 3.1415926535;
cout << pi;
```

Preferred over `float` when:
* Accuracy matters
* Large decimal values are used

6️⃣ Void Data Type (`void`)

The `void` data type represents no value.

It is mainly used with functions that **do not return anything**.
```cpp
void displayMessage() {
    cout << "Welcome to C++";
}
```
Key points:
* Indicates absence of a return value
* Cannot be used to declare normal variables
* Commonly used in function definitions

🔑 Summary of Data Types
* `char` → single character
* `int` → whole numbers
* `bool` → true/false values
* `floa`t → decimal numbers (less precision)
* `double` → decimal numbers (high precision)
* `void` → no return value

Understanding data types is crucial for:
* Memory management
* Correct program behavior
* Writing efficient DSA solutions

## 🔹 Type Safety in C++

C++ is a **type-safe language**, which means every variable must be used
according to its **declared data type**.

Type safety helps the compiler:
- Detect errors early (at compile time)
- Prevent invalid operations
- Avoid unexpected behavior at runtime

---

### Example of Type Safety

```cpp
int x = 10;
// x = "Hello";   ❌ Invalid
```
## 🔹 Type Safety in C++

C++ is a **type-safe language**, which means every variable must be used
according to its **declared data type**.

Type safety helps the compiler:
- Detect errors early (at compile time)
- Prevent invalid operations
- Avoid unexpected behavior at runtime

### Example of Type Safety

```cpp
int x = 10;
// x = "Hello";   ❌ Invalid
```
Explanation:
* `x` is declared as an `int`
* Assigning a string to an integer variable is not allowed
* The compiler throws an error

Why Type Safety Matters
| Benefit          | Explanation                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Error prevention | Catches mistakes before program runs |
| Code reliability | Ensures correct operations on data   |
| Easier debugging | Errors are detected early            |
| Safer programs   | Prevents unintended data misuse      |

Type safety is especially important in DSA, where incorrect data usage
can completely break logic.

## 🔹 Data Type Conversion

Data type conversion means converting a value from **one data type to another**.

C++ supports two types of conversion:
1. Implicit (Automatic)
2. Explicit (Type Casting)

1️⃣ Implicit Type Conversion (Automatic)

This conversion is done **automatically by the compiler**.
```cpp
int a = 10;
double b = a;   // int → double
```
Explanation:
* Integer value `10` is automatically converted to `10.0`
* No data loss occurs
* Also called widening conversion

Characteristics of Implicit Conversion
| Feature   | Description                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Automatic | Done by compiler           |
| Safe      | No data loss               |
| Widening  | Smaller → larger data type |

2️⃣ Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting)

Explicit conversion is done manually by the programmer.
```cpp
double x = 9.8;
int y = (int)x;
```
Explanation:
* Decimal part `.8` is discarded
* Result: `y = 9`
* Data loss may occur

Characteristics of Explicit Conversion
| Feature   | Description                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Manual    | Programmer controls conversion |
| Risky     | Data loss possible             |
| Narrowing | Larger → smaller data type     |

When to Use Explicit Conversion
* When precision loss is acceptable
* When logic demands integer values
* When compiler does not allow automatic conversion

---

## 🔹 Size of Data Types in C++

C++ provides the `sizeof()` operator to find how much memory
a data type occupies (in bytes).

Example
```cpp
cout << sizeof(int);
cout << sizeof(char);
cout << sizeof(float);
cout << sizeof(double);
```
Common Data Type Sizes (Typical)
| Data Type | Size (Bytes) |
| --------- | ------------ |
| `char`    | 1            |
| `bool`    | 1            |
| `int`     | 4            |
| `float`   | 4            |
| `double`  | 8            |
| `void`    | No storage   |

> ⚠️ Note: Sizes may vary depending on system architecture and compiler.

Why Size Matters in DSA
* Efficient memory usage
* Optimizing space complexity
* Handling large inputs safely

---

## 🔹 Data Type Modifiers

Data type modifiers are used to **modify the size or range of basic data types**.

They allow better control over memory and value range.

Common Data Type Modifiers
| Modifier   | Purpose                |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| `short`    | Reduces size           |
| `long`     | Increases size         |
| `signed`   | Allows negative values |
| `unsigned` | Only positive values   |

Examples of Modifiers
```cpp
short int x = 10;
long int distance = 123456789;
unsigned int count = 100;
signed int value = -20;
```
Comparison Example
| Data Type      | Range                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `int`          | −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| `unsigned int` | 0 to 4,294,967,295              |

Why Modifiers Are Useful
* Save memory
* Extend numeric range
* Avoid negative values where unnecessary
* Improve performance in some cases

✅ Summary
* Type safety ensures correct data usage
* Type conversion allows flexibility between data types
* `sizeof()` helps understand memory allocation
* Modifiers give control over size and range of values
These concepts are **critical for writing safe, optimized, and efficient C++ programs**,
especially when solving **DSA problems**.

## 🔹 Variables in C++

A **variable** is a named memory location used to store data during program execution.
The value of a variable can **change** while the program is running.

Variables are fundamental in programming because they allow us to:
- Store input values
- Perform calculations
- Control program flow
- Store intermediate results

### 🔹 Creating a Variable

Creating a variable involves **declaring** it with:
- A data type
- A variable name (identifier)

### Syntax

```cpp
data_type variable_name;
```
Examples
```cpp
int number;
float price;
char grade;
```
Components of a Variable
| Component     | Description                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Data type     | Defines what type of data can be stored |
| Variable name | Identifier used to access the data      |
| Memory        | Space allocated based on data type      |

bool isValid;

### 🔹 Initializing a Variable (Assignment Operator)

Initialization means assigning a value to a variable.

### Syntax
```cpp
variable_name = value;
```
or combined declaration and initialization:
```cpp
data_type variable_name = value;
```
Example
```cpp
int x = 10;
float marks = 85.5;
char grade = 'A';
```
**Assignment Operator (`=`)**
* Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left
* Not a comparison operator

### 🔹 Accessing and Updating Variables
Accessing a Variable
```cpp
int x = 10;
cout << x;
```
Updating a Variable
```cpp
int x = 5;
x = x + 2;   // x becomes 7
```
Variables can be updated multiple times during execution.

### 🔹 Rules for Naming Variables (Identifiers)

Identifiers are the names given to variables.

**Rules**
* Must start with a letter (a–z, A–Z) or underscore _
* Cannot start with a number
* No spaces allowed
* Cannot use C++ keywords
* Case-sensitive (count and Count are different)

Valid Identifiers
```cpp
int totalMarks;
int _count;
```
Invalid Identifiers
```cpp
int 1value;        // ❌ starts with number
int total marks;   // ❌ contains space
int float;         // ❌ keyword
float averageScore;
```
### 🔹 How Are Variables Used?
Variables are used to:
* Store user input
* Perform arithmetic operations
* Control conditions and loops
* Store results temporarily

Example
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int sum = a + b;

cout << sum;
```
Without variables, programs would not be dynamic or flexible.
